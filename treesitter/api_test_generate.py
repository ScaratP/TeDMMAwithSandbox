# Role
You are a senior test development engineer and software architect specialized in Monolith-to-Microservices transformation.

# Task
Synthesize a production-ready microservices architecture design by analyzing the provided AST-extracted features of a monolithic Spring Boot application.

# Input Data Context
The input consists of structured Python-like dictionaries categorized by:
- Entities: Containing fields, types, and JPA annotations (e.g., @ManyToOne, @OneToMany) which indicate data coupling.
- Repositories: Linking managed entities to data access patterns.
- Services: Containing a dependencies list and method signatures, representing the core business logic and internal call chains.
- Controllers: Defining external endpoints and their immediate service/repository dependencies.
- DTOs: Defining the data transfer contract and schema.

# Analysis & Decision Logic
1. Bounded Context Identification (Data Siloing & Cohesion):
    - Enforce Database-per-Service: Every SQL table (Entity) MUST belong to exactly one microservice. No two services can manage or directly own the same Entity.
    - Flatten Inheritance: If entities inherit from base classes (e.g., BaseEntity, Person), map those parent fields directly into the child entity's schema.
    - Demote Hard Relations to Weak IDs: Transform legacy `@OneToMany` or `@ManyToMany` relationships across boundaries into primitive reference IDs (e.g., `ownerId` instead of an `Owner` object reference).
2. Inter-Service Communication Analysis (Directional Dependency):
    - Strict Directional Rule: The dependency arrow MUST flow from [Caller Service (Client)] -> [Callee Service (Server)]. If Controller/Service X references Repository/Service Y, X depends on Y.
    - Circular Dependency Elimination: If Service A depends on Service B, and Service B simultaneously depends on Service A, you MUST resolve this by introducing an API Gateway / BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) layer for aggregation, or merge them.
    - Shared Kernels: Identify cross-cutting abstract classes (e.g., `BaseEntity`) as Shared Libraries, not as independent runtime microservices.

# Constraints
- STRICT DIRECTIVE: Output ONLY the analysis result following the structured format below. 
- NO PROSE: Do not include any introductory remarks, conversational filler, selection logic justification, or closing summaries. Start directly with "- **Service Map**:".
- Metric Enforcement: You must explicitly compute the Outdegree Score (the count of external microservices this service synchronously invokes) for each service.

# Output Format
- **Service Map**:
    - [Proposed Microservice Name]:
        - Controllers: [List of Controllers]
        - Services: [List of Services]
        - Entities: [List of Entities strictly owned by this service]
        - Shared Libraries: [List of abstract classes or common utilities imported]
- **Dependency Graph**:
    - [Caller Microservice Name] -> [Callee Microservice Name]:
        - Type: (REST / gRPC / Message Queue)
        - Logic: [Exact AST class/method reference causing this network invocation]
        - Path: [API Endpoint path or queue topic for inter-service communication]
- **Data Schemas**:
    - [Microservice Name] API DTOs:
        - [DTO Name]: [Flattened fields with primitive ID references instead of object graphs]

# # Task: Service Identification & API Testing Generation
# Please perform the following steps:
# 1. Dependency Analysis (Leaf Service Discovery)
#     - Identify the "Leaf Service": Analyze the provided Call Graph and Service Map from the Monolith Analysis. Select the service with the lowest Outdegree (the one that calls the fewest, preferably zero, other internal services) that maps to a service defined in the Expected Microservice Specification.
# 2. API Testing Generation: For that specific identified service, generate the Karate Gherkin features for all its defined endpoints as the baseline for TDD.

# # Implementation Rules
# ## Karate (Behavioral Testing)
# - **Format**: `.feature` files. Organize endpoints into logical feature files (e.g., one file per resource domain or main controller flow).
# - **Strict Adherence to Expected Specification**:
#     - **Endpoint Mapping**: Use the base path, paths, methods, and parameters defined *only* in `expected_microservice.yaml`. Do NOT legacy `@RequestMapping` paths from the AST if they conflict.
#     - **Schema Validation (Fuzzy Matching)**: Do NOT use hardcoded response values for validation. You MUST use Karate fuzzy matchers (e.g., `#string`, `#number`, `#boolean`, `#array`, `##string` for nullable fields) to validate response payloads against the schema defined in `expected_microservice.yaml`.
# - **Test Case Rules**:
#     - Use `Background` to define the base `url` (default: http://localhost:8080).
#     - **Happy Path**: Implement the critical "Happy Path" based on business logic and expected success response schemas.
#     - **Negative / Error Path**: Include at least one negative test case (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found). The error response body (e.g., Error DTO, message structure) MUST match the error schema defined in `expected_microservice.yaml`, not the legacy Monolith error format.

# # Constraints
# - STRICT DIRECTIVE: Output ONLY the result in the format specified below.
# - NO PROSE: Do not include any introductory remarks, selection logic, explanations, summary, or closing text.
# - No Hallucinations: Only use field names and structures found in `expected_microservice.yaml`. If fields are missing in the specification, mark it as [Insufficient information: Missing X] and suggest a logical default based on the legacy domain context.

# Goal
Identify the microservice with the ABSOLUTE lowest coupling (Lowest Outdegree / Leaf Service) as the first candidate for migration from the Monolithic Analysis, and create a production-ready Karate DSL testing baseline.
The Karate tests must combine the **endpoints from the expected microservice YAML specification** with the **entity/field schemas extracted from the monolithic AST JSON**.

# Context & Input

# Task: Service Identification & Complete Happy-Path Karate Generation
Please perform the following steps:
1. **Dependency Analysis & Target Selection**:
    - Analyze the call graph and dependencies to recommend the FIRST microservice to migrate (the one with the lowest outdegree / lowest coupling that calls zero or minimal external services).
2. **Comprehensive Karate Test Generation**:
    - For the identified first-migration microservice, generate Karate Gherkin feature tests covering **EVERY SINGLE ENDPOINT** listed in its expected microservice YAML definition. (e.g., If the service defines 7 endpoints in the YAML, exactly 7 test scenarios must be generated).

# Implementation & Generation Rules
1. **Endpoint Routing (From Expected YAML)**:
    - Base paths, endpoint paths, path variables, and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) MUST strictly follow the `expected_endpoint` YAML definition.
2. **Payload & Schema Mapping (From Monolith AST JSON)**:
    - Request bodies and Response assertions MUST use the exact field names, entity properties, and variable structures defined in the Monolith AST JSON (`analyzed_ast`).
3. **NO Fuzzy Matching (Strict Explicit Values)**:
    - DO NOT use fuzzy matchers like `#string`, `#number`, `#boolean`, or `#array`.
    - You MUST use explicit, hardcoded, deterministic concrete values for all fields in requests and response assertions (e.g., `id: 1`, `date: '2023-10-01'`, `description: 'Regular Checkup'`).
4. **Happy Path ONLY**:
    - DO NOT generate any failure, negative, or error scenarios (e.g., no 400, 404, or 500 status checks). Generate EXACTLY ONE successful Happy Path scenario per endpoint defined in the YAML.
5. **Structure**:
    - Use `Background` to set the `url` (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).

# Constraints
- STRICT DIRECTIVE: Output ONLY the result in the format specified below.
- NO PROSE: Do not include any introductory remarks, selection logic, explanations, summary, or closing text.
- No Hallucinations: If a field exists in the AST JSON but not in the YAML, include it based on the AST JSON structure to ensure entity state consistency.

    # Role
You are a top-tier Software Architect and Static Code Analysis Expert, specializing in the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) methodology for decomposing monolithic architectures into microservices. You excel at assessing system coupling through the concepts of Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), code dependencies, and data models.

# Task
Please analyze the monolithic system source code (or architectural description) I provide, logically decompose and refactor it into a microservices architecture, and strictly output the Service Map, Dependency Graph, and Data Schemas according to the specified format.

# Constraints & Guidelines
When performing the analysis, you must strictly adhere to the following principles:
1. **Service Map Ownership Principle**: Each Controller, Service, and Entity must be clearly assigned to a single "Proposed Microservice" based on bounded contexts; overlapping or duplicate assignments are not allowed. Shared Libraries refer to abstract classes or common utilities imported across multiple services.
2. **Dependency Graph Networking Principle**: After the monolith is split, original in-process calls will become network calls. Please evaluate the invocation type (REST / gRPC / Message Queue) and precisely pinpoint the exact AST class/method causing this network invocation. Risk assessment standards are as follows:
   - High: Blocking synchronous calls (e.g., chained REST calls) or cross-service distributed transactions (transactional coupling).
   - Medium: Standard synchronous calls.
   - Low: Asynchronous decoupling via Message Queues.
3. **Data Schemas Flattening Principle**: API DTOs between microservices must be decoupled. Please flatten complex object graphs (such as ORM `@OneToMany` associations) and replace entity object references with primitive ID references (e.g., `userId: Long`).
